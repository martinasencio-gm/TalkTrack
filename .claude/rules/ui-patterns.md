# UI Patterns: reusable widget conventions and Qt gotchas

## CollapsibleSection (`app/ui/collapsible_section.py`)

- Reusable widget with a banded header (QFrame `#collapsibleHeader`) and collapsible content area.
- Emits `toggled(bool)` signal. Exposes `add_header_widget(widget)` for right-aligned extras (e.g., Refresh button).
- When collapsed, `setMaximumHeight(header_height)` so it can't claim empty space via layout stretch.
- **Dynamic stretch pattern**: when wrapping a CollapsibleSection in a parent QVBoxLayout, connect `toggled` to `setStretchFactor(widget, 1 if expanded else 0)`. This lets sibling sections absorb freed space when one is collapsed. See `MainWindow._setup_ui` for Audio Sources + Recordings example.
  - **Gotcha — all-collapsed case**: with only dynamic section stretches, collapsing every section leaves the layout with no claimant and Qt distributes the empty space oddly (centering one section, dropping the other to the bottom). Add a trailing `addStretch(0)` spacer and flip its stretch to 1 when no section is expanded, 0 otherwise — see `MainWindow._update_left_panel_stretch`.

## Left panel layout

- Fixed width 400px (`left_panel.setFixedWidth(400)`, objectName `leftPanel`). Intentionally non-draggable — prevents layout jitter on collapse/expand.
- Left-pane font size reduced to 9pt via QSS `#leftPanel QLabel, #leftPanel QRadioButton, ...`. Timer keeps 13pt via `#leftPanel #timerLabel`.
- Section title bands use `QFrame#collapsibleHeader` with `background-color: #313244` (Catppuccin surface0) and `border-radius: 4px`.

## DAW meter fill direction (`_VerticalMeter` in `meters_panel.py`)

- Bar fills **upward from bottom** as volume rises (standard DAW).
- Implementation: paint color zones over full height, then fill the **empty region ABOVE current level** with background color (`0` to `current_y`), NOT below. Getting this backwards makes the bar look like it's losing color as you speak.
- Peak hold line: 3px `#f5e0dc` (rosewater) — stands out against green/yellow/red and the dark empty region.

## Peak-sample vs RMS bar

- `_VerticalMeter` drives the bar from the **peak sample** (`20·log10(max|x|)`), not RMS. Reason: with an RMS bar, the peak-hold line floats several dB above the bar's top *always* (RMS < peak for any real signal), which reads as "the line doesn't match the bar". With a peak-sample bar, the hold line sits AT the bar's top while rising and only floats above during the hold/decay phase — the DAW convention.
- The held peak has its own state (`_peak_abs` + hold/decay via `peak_hold_value`) — independent of the bar. Don't unify them or the hold animation disappears.
- 2px outline in surface0 (`#313244`) around each channel so the meter frame is visible even when silent. Drawn last so it overdraws the top/bottom of the color fills; acceptable cosmetic loss at those exact edges.
- Scale ticks: `[0, -18, -40, -60]` at 11px. `-6` overlapped `0` at this font size; `-40` is useful enough to keep over a four-tick scale.

## Qt QSS gotchas

- Plain `QWidget` subclasses don't render `background-color` from QSS unless you set `WA_StyledBackground` attribute. Symptom: `#myPanel { background-color: X }` appears to apply everywhere or nowhere predictably.
- Cleaner alternatives: (a) wrap in a `QFrame` with an object name and style the frame, (b) custom `paintEvent` with `painter.drawRoundedRect`, (c) palette + `setAutoFillBackground(True)`.
- `QLabel`, `QFrame`, and similar DO render QSS backgrounds — scope them explicitly with `#parentId QLabel { ... }` to avoid cascade surprises.

## Palette

Catppuccin Mocha throughout. Common shades:
- Base: `#1e1e2e` — app bg
- Mantle: `#181825` — darker sections
- Surface0: `#313244` — bands, subtle lifts
- Text: `#cdd6f4`
- Blue accent: `#89b4fa`
- Red (clip/mute): `#f38ba8`
- Green (healthy): `#a6e3a1`
- Yellow (hot): `#f9e2af`
- Rosewater (peak line): `#f5e0dc`

## System tray (MainWindow)

- **Popup suppression while hidden**: any background-triggered `QMessageBox` in `main_window.py` must be guarded with `if self._is_hidden_to_tray()` — show the red/green tray overlay via `_flag_error_notification()` / `_flag_success_notification()` instead of popping a modal the user can't see. Applies to worker-completion / error callbacks. User-initiated popups (menu actions, delete prompts) don't need the guard since the window is visible.
- **`_really_quit` flag + `_confirm_exit`**: the X button and tray Quit both funnel through `closeEvent`. `_confirm_exit()` shows the exit dialog with a recording-aware body; setting `_really_quit = True` bypasses the dialog for reentrant calls. Don't add new direct-quit paths without going through this.
- **`changeEvent` must NOT hijack minimize**: it used to intercept `WindowMinimized` and swap in the compact strip or `hide()` to the tray, so the standard Windows gesture did something non-standard. Minimize now always minimizes to the taskbar. `changeEvent`'s only job is on the way back *up*: dismissing a strip that stands in for a minimized window. Don't reintroduce a minimize intercept.
- **Hiding vs. minimizing**: `hide()` removes the taskbar entry — that's the tray, reached only from the close button's "minimize instead" choice when `general.close_to_tray` is on. Compact bar and pill use `showMinimized()` so the window keeps its taskbar entry and can't be lost behind the floating strip.

## Window presentation chain (MainWindow)

- One ordered chain: `full → compact_bar → pill → full`, walked by `_advance_presentation()` via the Qt-free `app/ui/window_presentation.next_presentation()`. Double-click on the capture bar *or* the strip shrinks one step; `ui.double_click_target` picks which shrunken state a double-click from the full window lands on (so `"pill"` yields `full → pill → full`).
- **The strip doesn't own the chain.** `CompactStrip.mouseDoubleClickEvent` emits a single `shrink_requested` and changes nothing itself — MainWindow decides. Keep it that way, or the same gesture starts meaning different things on different surfaces.
- **`_strip_is_minimized_form`** distinguishes the strip's two roles: minimized stand-in for the window (dismissed when the user restores from the taskbar) vs. a free-floating panel opened from View ▸ Show Compact Strip (left alone). A direct View-menu toggle clears it.
- **The activity widget is suppressed while the strip is visible** (`_update_activity_visibility`). Compact/pill mode *is* a minimized window now, so without that check both floating widgets stack on screen while recording — and the strip already renders the busy states itself.
