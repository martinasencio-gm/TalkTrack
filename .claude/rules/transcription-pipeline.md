# Transcription Pipeline: worker lifecycle, session binding, queueing, model caches

Invariants from issues #19–#21, #27–#28. Violating the first two reproduces cross-recording data corruption or crash-on-exit.

## Session binding — never read `_current_session` in completion handlers

Every pipeline worker (`TranscriptionWorker`, `DiarizationWorker`, `SimpleDiarizeWorker`) carries a `.session` attribute bound at creation. Completion/error handlers read the worker's session, not `self._current_session` — the user may have selected a different recording while the worker ran. Results whose session is no longer displayed are persisted via `_write_transcript_for_session` (own directory, own speaker names) without touching the UI, and auto-summarize is skipped for them (the summarize path reads notes/instruction from the *displayed* panels).

## Serial job queue

- `_start_transcription(audio_path, session=None)` queues `(audio_path, session)` in `_pending_transcriptions` when busy; never silently drops.
- `_transcription_busy()` covers ALL THREE workers (transcription, pyannote diarization, simple diarization) — one job (transcribe → diarize → display/save) runs at a time.
- Every terminal path (display, transcription error, cancel, diarization error) must call `_process_pending_transcriptions()` or the queue stalls.

## Shutdown

- `closeEvent` sets `self._closing = True` BEFORE `recorder.stop_recording()` — the synchronous `recording_finished` signal would otherwise spawn a fresh worker mid-exit. `_start_transcription` early-returns when closing.
- `_shutdown_workers()` handles all QThread workers (plus chat + search workers via `active_worker()` accessors): cooperative cancel where supported, `wait(5000)`, `terminate()` last resort. New background workers must be added to its list.

## Diarization error paths show the transcript

Diarization (full or simple) failing must still render/persist the successful transcript (`worker.transcript_result`). A silent drop here was the original #14 bug.

## Model caches — resident by design

- `transcriber._MODEL_CACHE` — WhisperModel keyed `(model_size, device, compute_type)`.
- `diarizer._PIPELINE_CACHE` — pyannote Pipeline keyed by HF token.
- `provider.get_sentence_transformer()` — shared embed model cache.
Loading costs seconds-to-tens-of-seconds per recording; models staying in RAM/VRAM between recordings is intentional. Don't "fix" it.

## Per-track transcription (the default "simple" path)

- `track_merge.dual_track_plan(session, diarization_enabled, hf_token)` decides: both `mic`/`system` files present on disk AND pyannote not going to run → `[("You", mic), ("Remote", system)]`, passed to `TranscriptionWorker(tracks=...)`. Otherwise None and the mix is transcribed as before.
- Pyannote must keep getting the **mixed** audio — it clusters voices across the whole file. Never split the tracks for it.
- `_on_transcription_finished` checks `worker.tracks` FIRST and goes straight to `_display_final_transcript`: the segments are already labelled, so `SimpleDiarizeWorker` must not run on top of them.
- `merge_tracks` only ever drops segments from the **first** track. Mic goes first because it's the only track that can hold a bleed copy — a loopback of the render stream cannot pick up the user's voice. Reversing the order would delete real remote speech.
- A track that fails to transcribe is logged and skipped, not fatal — a recording with only one usable track still produces a transcript.
- `worker.bleed_dropped` counts the removed duplicates; `MainWindow._warn_speaker_bleed` surfaces it once per app session above `BLEED_WARNING_SEGMENTS` and suggests headphones. Tray-hidden suppresses the modal (status label only), same as the silent-capture warning.

## SimpleDiarizer

Now reached only when `dual_track_plan` declines but metadata still names both tracks — in practice a track file that's named but missing from disk. Its error path already renders the transcript, so that lands as an unlabelled transcript rather than a failure.

- Runs off-thread via `SimpleDiarizeWorker` (reads both full WAVs — froze the UI inline).
- Indexes each track with its OWN sample rate (`mic_sr` / `sys_sr`) — mic and system tracks can legitimately differ; a single shared rate made You/Remote labels random (#28).

## Segment metadata

- `TranscriptSegment.confidence` = `exp(segment.avg_logprob)` — populated since #29.
- `word_timestamps` is deliberately NOT requested (unused output, real alignment cost). If a feature needs word timing, re-enable it and actually consume `segment.words`.
